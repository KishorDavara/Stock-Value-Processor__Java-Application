-  Reads in a large CSV file containing information about different stocks at different times in random order (unsorted).  
-  Find the stock with the largest absolute increase from its first recording to its last recording, then output the result to the command line.  
-  Skips the unavailable data (such as N/A; unknown; none; etc.)
